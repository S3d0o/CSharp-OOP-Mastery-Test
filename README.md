# CSharp-OOP-Mastery-Test 💻

A C# project demonstrating mastery of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with practical, real-world examples.

## 🚀 Features

- Abstract base class `Employee` with derived classes `SalariedEmployee` and `HourlyEmployee`
- Use of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Interface implementation: `ICloneable`, `ITaxable`,`ICombarable<>`
- Factory pattern via `EmployeeFactory`
- Operator overloading (`+`) for combining teams
- Team and project management classes
- Deep cloning vs shallow cloning demonstration
- Dictionary and collection manipulation
- Clean, extensible architecture

## 🧱 Project Structure

- `Models/` – Contains core class definitions
- `Collections/` – Includes `Team` and logic for employee collections
- `Program.cs` – Demonstrates real use cases and interactions
- `Interfaces/` – Shared behavior contracts
